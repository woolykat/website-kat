			<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
			<p>I worked with another UX placement designer who was finishing their placement year&comma; he helped me in learning new front-end skills&comma; for example using SasS to compile CSS and the BEM-model to structure the class names and to use proper naming conventions. I found this really helpful&comma; as I was able to ask for advice from experienced designers in writing front-end code. I found this extremely beneficial as I was learning a lot of new skills at once&comma; and with the assistance from other designers helped me gain a better understanding of the tasks I needed to complete.</p>

			<p>I worked with a senior UX designer&comma; which gave me great insight into understanding the design process, creating user journeys etc. I found working with someone who had so much experience gave me a lot of knowledge around creating user journeys. I worked with business analysts to help get a better idea of what needs to be created for specific journeys. This proved a great help as this allowed me to ask questions to see exactly what and why we needed particular elements.</p>

			<p>Working alongside developers was beneficial in allowing me to gain experience in using git command line and creating pull requests through the terminal. They provided me with a range of new skills in learning how to create branches and also how to review other people’s code when pushing to visual studios. As this was all new to me&comma; I believe I have learnt a lot from working alongside developers for over nine months. Currently I am working more closing with a wider team of designers&comma; researchers and content designers&comma; allowing me to get more experience in seeing how research and content plays an important part in UX design.</p>

			<h3>My role during placement</h3>
			<p>During my time at Kainos I took on the role of a front-end developer on the <a href="https://lttservice.wra.gov.wales/home/register" class="link-wra">Welsh Revenue Authority</a> project&comma; this is where I updated and created a style-guide that consisted of all the design elements from a pattern library. I provided code snippets for each design pattern to enable developers to easily implement the code. I was also in charge of ensuring all design components were cross browser compatible and designed for particular devices. This sometimes was tricky due to the application being mostly used in “Internet Explorer”&comma; but I learnt a lot in doing so. I also took on the role of UX designer by creating user journeys and solving problems within these. This enabled me to get a great experience and gain more confidence in both front-end development and UX design.</p>

			<h3>Placement Competencies</h3>
			<p>I was able to take over the role of a previous placement student and learn new skills in order to maintain and update the style guide. I was able to achieve this and successfully update and create new design patterns using SasS and the BEM-model throughout the whole project. I felt this was one of my biggest accomplishments&comma; as I needed to learn new skills as soon as possible and put them into practice before the placement student had left. I felt a little under pressure to begin with but after a few weeks of tutorials and guidance I was able to start updating the style guide and already creating my own code using the new methods and techniques the previous placement was using. I learnt so much from working on the Welsh Revenue as a front end develop for nine months and will be able to make use of these abilities in the future.</p> 
		
			<h3>Learning and Skills</h3>
			<p>I have learnt many new skills within Kainos, both front end and UX design. When working with front-end code to build a pattern library I learnt how to use SasS and the BEM-model and through using this, gained more effective ways to write my code. For example&comma; when using SasS it’s much easier and cleaner to create responsive designs. I believe these abilities will benefit me a lot and I will continue to write in SasS instead of CSS as this prevents duplication and enables me to write reusable code. I learnt how to use the terminal and push my updates to the style guide through this to Visual Studios using git commands. I now have skills to create pull requests through the terminal&comma; create new branches&comma; and commit my updates to Visual studios to allow developers to review my code. If there were any issues the developer and I would quickly be able to resolve this by looking at how the code compared to its previous revision. I made use of many new software programs including Sketch&comma; Marvel app&comma; Invision - which I picked up quickly and was able to make good use of when creating user journeys and creating prototypes. With user journeys&comma; the main thing I learnt was to always ask the right questions&comma; for example to ensure I have a good understanding of what exactly is needed&comma; why is it needed and whom is it directed to. I found having discussions with the business analyst and senior UX designer helped greatly. I also made use of “Realtime” board for collaborating with many other team members&comma; which allowed everyone to add their own input or opinion on a particular idea. I also made use of this software on a workshop where team members interacted with a touch screen TV to help identify particular parts on a car. This was a workshop to help develop an idea on the DVSA project I am currently on&comma; I found the interactive session really enjoyable and it enabled us to quickly understand any issues we had with specific ideas.</p>

			<h3>Response to Feedback</h3>
			<p>I received some feedback and advice on using the git command line&comma; as this software was new to me I found it a bit confusing to begin with. I noticed I wasn’t pulling down the new version of code each time but I couldn’t understand why, for example not branching off the master. I knew this could cause conflicts within the code when someone else was making a change. So&comma; I then asked a developer for some advice and feedback on the current way I was pushing my code and showed my process of creating branches etc. The developer was able to explain this clearly and outline what my issue was, which was simply going back to the master each time. I found this really helpful as now each time I remember to always go back to master&comma; this saves any conflicts arising in the code down the line. As I asked for feedback when I had the problem&comma; the issue was solved much quicker and I was able to carry out the correct process. I recieved feedback throughout my time at Kainos, weather this be myself asking for feedback or other team members offering their help and advice. Below you can read a snippet of feedback I recieved from a team member on the Welsh Revenue Authority project.</p>
			<blockquote cite="David (Software Enigneer)">Katrina always made herself available to help when new components were needed &lpar;that styles didn't already exist for) and was always super quick at getting back to me (usually a message with a link to a pull request with the work already done in record time&excl;&rpar;.</blockquote>

			<h3>Challenges, Achievements and Disappointments</h3>
			<p>I found it challenging at the beginning of my placement as I was being introduced to front end skills that I have never used before&comma; and this can be quite overwhelming to begin with. Through working with other UX designers and developers I was able to understand and learn many new abilities. The biggest challenge was to take over the role of the style-guide and start learning new coding skills from the second day in&comma; as I was replacing the previous placement student. I needed to get up to speed on SasS&comma; BEM model&comma; git command line&comma; terminal&comma; etc all within a month of starting. This I feel was my biggest achievement in all of my placement&comma; as I was able to quickly learn off a designer the basics of the style-guide then it was over to me to keep creating new front-end code and develop these new skills through more tutorials or simply asking developers for help. When the placement student left I was the only front-end developer on the team so I felt this was a great achievement in successfully creating the style-guide independently with developers until the project had ended.<p>

			<p>During my time creating the style guide I came across many problems within making the code compatible on all browsers, in particular Internet Explorer. I found this very challenging at times&comma; even when I paired up with another developer to get some help&comma; it was very tricky to get certain elements to appear exactly how it would on chrome etc. I enjoyed solving these issues with other developers&comma; as we were able to work together to research a solution&comma; it gave me sense of great satisfaction when we fixed any of these issues. It also helped me build my own library of particular code snippets that would be useful to use in future if I ever come across similar issues again. I found problem solving this issue gave me a lot more confidence in designing for all browsers. I was able to troubleshoot many different issues with front-end code throughout my time on the Welsh revenue project.</p>

			<h3>Impact of the Placement</h3>
			<p>The overall impact I feel placement has given me is developing my skills in front-end development and designing user journeys. I have gained more confidence in this role by attending all meetings&comma; providing my input&comma; sharing what I’m working on in stand ups and going to conferences in and outside of Kainos. I was able to work with the wider team of designers&comma; working with user researchers&comma; content designers and consultant designers&comma; which helped greatly when working on user journeys to get people’s views from a content and research view point.</p>
		
			<h3>Personal and Professional Development</h3>
			<p>I wanted to get more involved in front-end and expand my skills in this area when starting Kainos&comma; so my first project was great in helping me do this&comma; as I learned many new skills in creating the style guide. I then wanted to expand my knowledge and skills within design more&comma; for example user journeys&comma; wire framing and prototyping. I was able to do this on DVSA and develop various prototypes with the senior UX designer. I found getting experience in both areas of front end and UX design helped when creating quick code prototypes.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Overall my experience at Kainos has been a year where I was pushed out of my comfort zone&comma; ultimately allowing me to gain more confidence in my work and learn new skills in front end and UX design. I found stand ups a great way for me to become more confident&comma; as this allowed me to speak in front of the team every morning and explain what work I was doing and what work I was planning for that day. I have gained so much knowledge within both front end and UX design&comma; I found I was able to work independently and within teams which was a great experience to be given the responsibility and opportunity to work on particular things independently&comma; as this gave me great confidence that I was adding value to the project.</p>
