            <h5 class="introduction">Introduction</h5>
            <p class="paragraphs">I will discuss what opioids are and what types of pain they use it for. In relation to this, I will explore <b>why the opioid crisis is a huge problem in America</b>. I will do this through showing <b>how addictive they are, how prescription opioids account for a large number of deaths</b>, and how people are receiving opioids too long after surgery when it's not required. I will outline some side effects of opioids to show how many people can experience these. In addition to this, I will discuss how this crisis is having an <b>impact on the US</b>. I will do this through showing how many deaths are occurring and how much it's costing the US for this crises.</p>

            <p class="paragraphs">I will then explore how <b>virtual reality could help the opioid crisis</b>. I will give a brief outline of what VR is and then discuss how it could help reduce opioids to prevent addiction. I will do this by explaining the various trials and studies that researchers and technology organisations have carried out.
            I also will deliberate how <b>doctors are agreeing that VR is effective in reducing pain and reducing opioids consumption to prevent addiction</b>. I will also talk about Brennan Spiegel&lsquor; a researcher at Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles&lsquor; who has carried out various trials with patients and give quotes from people who have <b>experienced VR to reduce their pain</b>.</p>

            <p class="paragraphs">These studies also show that in <b>some cases opioids are not needed</b>. I will discuss the studies and prototypes of virtual reality and how it could <b>decrease the number of prescribed opioids given to patients</b>&lsquor; how it can help assist in their recovery process and how cost effective having your own headset could be. To summarise I will highlight the key points in <b>why opioids is a huge crisis in America, how it's impacting Amercia and how VR can help reduce opioids to prevent addiction</b>.</p>

            <h5 class="h5-opioid-subheadings mar-top-0">What Are Opioids?</h5>
            <p class="paragraphs"><b>Opioids block pain signals sent from the brain to the body</b>&lsquor; most people use prescription opioids for chronic pain as well as acute pain. There are various forms of opioids&lsquor; for example&lsquor; hydrocodone&lsquor; oxymorphone&lsquor; morphine&lsquor; codeine&lsquor; and fentanyl&lsquor; which are common prescription opioids. Opioids such as morphine and fentanyl are used in treating moderate to severe pain, for example after surgery&lsquor; chronic pain&lsquor; patients with poor heart function and many more. They can be taken in many different forms&lsquor; for example&lsquor; injections&lsquor; tablets&lsquor; liquids&lsquor; and patches. The &lsquo;National Institute on Drug Abuse&rsquo;&lsquor; who is making advances on addiction science states&colon; &ldquo;opioids release large amounts of dopamine. This release can strongly reinforce the act of taking the drug, making the user want to repeat the experience.&rdquo; This suggests how <b>addictive opioids can be and is the cause of many deaths due to overdoses</b>&lsquor; this is why it's a huge problem within America. Opioids are highly addictive, resulting in thousands of deaths each year.</p>

            <p class="paragraphs">A statement from the &lsquo;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo; who are a leading national public health institute of the United States states&colon; &ldquo;Every day&lsquor; 91 Americans die from an opioid-related overdose&rdquo;. This shows how dangerous opioids can be&lsquor; with a large number of people dying every day. According to &lsquo;Pain Doctor&rsquo;&lsquor; a website that helps people learn more about their conditions&lsquor; states&colon; &ldquo;25 million Americans suffer daily pain&rdquo; and &lsquo;American Psychiatric Association&rsquo;&lsquor; who ensures people receive effective treatment for those with mental illness&lsquor; states that: &ldquo;an estimated <b>2 million people have a substance disorder</b>.&rdquo; Not only are thousands of people dying&lsquor; but millions of people are addicted and misusing opioids&lsquor; which will only lead to <b>more and more deaths occurring each year.</b></p>

            <p class="paragraphs">A <b><a class="documentary-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9KRdqwQcdo" title="A link to the documentary on the drug crisis in America">documentary on the deadliest drug crisis</a></b> in America interviews a police officer&lsquor; Andy Teague from Ohio who talks about how the <b>police forces need to carry a heroin antidote</b> around as they treat people with this up to 4 or 5 times a day. This shows how it's having a huge impact on America, that the police force now need to carry antidotes.</p>

            <h5 class="h5-opioid-subheadings">Patients Are Receiving Opioids Too Long after Surgery</h5>
            <p class="paragraphs">In some cases <b>patients can become reliant on drugs after surgery</b>&lsquor; because of how opioid molecules act on the brain&lsquor; this may make them misuse it and become addicted. In 2017 the University of Michigan researched opioid addiction across various schools to find out how prescribing can be improved&lsquor; they state&colon; &ldquo;1 in 20 young adults uses opioids for too long after common surgeries&rdquo; and &ldquo;teens were getting refills three to six months after a surgery.&rdquo;<b> Patients continue to get refills long after surgery</b>&lsquor; why is this? Is there not a restricted number of opioids you receive?</p>

            <p class="paragraphs">Jay Lee&lsquor; a researcher from the University of Michigan says&colon; &ldquo; it&apos;s embarrassing to admit this&lsquor; but <b>we&apos;ve never had any evidence to inform how much opioids we prescribe to surgical patients.</b>&rdquo; I find this very alarming as some patients could become addicted to a drug that they could have stopped taking months ago.</p>

            <p class="paragraphs">The longer someone is taking an opioid they are at at higher risk of becoming addicted&lsquor; as stated in a video from &lsquo;Free Think&rsquo;&lsquor; a publication that profiles &lsquo;people thinking differently and making a difference&rsquo;&lsquor; states&colon; &ldquo;if you take one dose of opioids&lsquor; there is a 6% chance that 12 months later you will be dependent on it.&rdquo; This suggests how highly addictive this drug can be&lsquor; and when <b>people are receiving prescriptions long after surgeries they are more at risk at becoming addicted</b> and could lead to death if an overdose occurs. This is why opioids are a huge problem.</p>

            <p class="paragraphs">Providing more <b>non-addictive options are needed for patients</b>. Doctors need to offer this first and be more strict on prescribing opioids. Dr. Jennifer Waljee&lsquor; who is a co-director of the &lsquo;Michigan opioids prescribing engagement network&rsquo;&lsquor; gives her insight into non-addictive options&lsquor; she states: &ldquo;asking patients about their preferences for pain control after surgery and their prior experiences with surgery&lsquor; this can reduce the prescribing of opioids and on top of this&lsquor; surgeons may offer patients non-opioid approaches to pain.&rdquo; Although <b>I don&apos;t believe that every doctor and surgeon will provide non-opioid options</b>&lsquor; as you can see from the research that the University of Michigan carried out, <b>people are receiving opioids three to six months after surgery when it isn&apos;t required</b>. Again, this is why <b>opioids are a huge problem</b>.</p>

            <p class="paragraphs"><b>Many deaths occur to prescription opioids</b>&lsquor; doctors should be monitoring this more closely in order to stop the number of opioids being prescribed. A lot of people use opioids for chronic pain&lsquor; which is pain that lasts more than 12 weeks&lsquor; months or longer. According to the VR &lsquo;Fitness Insider&rsquo;&lsquor; who focuses on how VR and AR can improve health and fitness&lsquor; states&colon; <b>&ldquo;more than 100 million people in America are living with chronic pain</b>&lsquor; with the US accounting for 80% of painkiller use worldwide in 2017.&rdquo; This shows how huge the opioids crisis is in Amercia due to the number of painkillers it accounts for worldwide. This is why so many people are becoming addicted. Especially patients with chronic pain, as they could be taking opioids for months or years.</p>

                        </div>

            <h5 class="h5-opioid-subheadings">Opioid Side Effects</h5>
            <p class="paragraphs">Opioids can have various side effects&lsquor; these can vary depending on the person and how long people are taking the drug for. Some <b>side effects are drowsiness&lsquor; confusion&lsquor; nausea&lsquor; vomiting&lsquor; and slowed breathing</b>. Many people can experience side effects of these drugs&lsquor; as stated in the &lsquo;Faculty Of Pain Medicine&rsquo; who is responsible for training and development of specialist medical practitioners states: &ldquo;50 - 80% of patients experience at least one side effect.&rdquo;

                <p class="paragraphs">So how serious can the side effects be if someone is misusing the drug? Misuse of this drug can cause <b>hypoxia&lsquor; a condition when too little oxygen reaches the brain</b>. When this happens it can have long-term effects&lsquor; such as a <b>coma&lsquor; permanent brain damage&lsquor; and death</b>. People can also experience respiratory depression&lsquor; which is a breathing disorder&lsquor; with slow ineffective breathing. This can be more severe the higher the dose of opioids and sometimes can lead to respiratory failure&lsquor; which is the most common cause for death in someone that has an overdose.</p>

                <div id="opioid-impact"></div>
                <h4 class="opioids-h4 margin-top">How Opioids Are Having an Impact on America</h4>
                <h5 class="h5-opioid-subheadings mar-top-0">Shocking Statistics</h5>
                <p class="paragraphs">When you look at statistics showing how big this crisis is&lsquor; it&apos;s alarming to read how many people are dying due to overdoses in America. A statistic from the &lsquo;Centers for Disease Control&rsquo; states&colon; &ldquo;72&lsquor;000 overdose deaths in 2017 were attributed to opioids.&rdquo; That&apos;s around <b>6&lsquor;000 people dying each month</b> and it&apos;s a 13% increase from 2016&lsquor; with 63&lsquor;632 deaths. The problem has only gotten worse&lsquor; with the increase in deaths rising much higher from 2015 with 52&lsquor;404 deaths.</p>

                <p class="paragraphs">An article from &lsquo;Ashwood Recovery&rsquo;&lsquor; who is a &lsquo;private highly specialised&lsquor; substance abuse treatment center&rsquo; states&lsquor; &ldquo;every new year sets a new record – <b>for 19 consecutive years&lsquor; overdose deaths increased by 421%</b>.&rdquo; This highlights that over the last 19 years from 1999 to 2017&lsquor; the number of deaths have only gotten higher and will continue to grow as people are becoming reliant on these drugs. The United States Department of Health and Human Services says&colon; &ldquo;<b>2 million people misused the prescription opioids</b> for the first time in 2016 and 2017.&rdquo;</p>

                <p class="paragraphs">Not only are thousands of people dying but millions of people are misusing opioids&lsquor; resulting in overdose deaths. This highlights how addictive opioids are&lsquor; even when people are taking prescription opioids. <b>If the number of opioids could be reduced&lsquor; people will become less dependent on these drugs</b>.</p>

                <p class="paragraphs new-para">Researchers at Mayo Clinic&lsquor; who specialises in treating patients states&colon; &ldquo;the odds you&apos;ll still be on opioids a year after starting a short course&lsquor; increase&lsquor; after only five days, on opioids.&rdquo; So even <b>after taking the opioid for a few days they are at risk of becoming addicted</b>. Are opioids really necessary for every time someone has pain? In my opinion, no&lsquor; as patients will eventually become addicted, especially someone with chronic pain, which can last months and even years in some cases, meaning they could be taking opioids for years. I agree with Mayo Clinic who states&colon; &ldquo;<b>opioids are a last resort</b> for chronic pain management&lsquor; they may be the right choice for long-term pain related cancer and it&apos;s treatments.&rdquo;
                    <p>

                        <p class="paragraphs new-para">I understand people can react differently to medications&lsquor; what works for one person may not for the next person, and opioids are needed for some cases such as cancer treatment. Although I strongly feel that the <b>focus on reducing the opioids given to patients and making it the last resort</b> should be the case in all patients&lsquor; and <b>ensuring patients are not receiving prescription opioids for longer than needed</b>. A statement from &lsquo;Inspiring Wellness&rsquo;&lsquor; who help people that suffers from addiction and their recovery says&colon; &ldquo;40% percent of these opioid-related deaths involved prescription opioids in 2016.&rdquo; That&apos;s around <b>25&lsquor;500 people deaths due to prescribed opioids</b>&lsquor; which shows that patients are becoming dependent on prescription opioids.</p>

                        <h5 class="h5-opioid-subheadings">How Much Money Is the Crisis Having on the US</h5>
                        <p class="paragraphs">As the opioid crisis is growing&lsquor; so is the cost for medical care&lsquor; according to &lsquo;Market Watch&rsquo;&lsquor; who provides the latest stock market&lsquor; financial and business news&lsquor; says&colon; &ldquo;the crisis is costing the U.S more than $500 billion per year nationwide&rdquo;&lsquor;&ldquo;28 million on medical care alone&rdquo; and &ldquo;the <b>annual cost of addiction to prescription opioids is $3&lsquor;500 to $70&lsquor;000</b>.&rdquo; These are worrying figures as this shows how much it&apos;s costing for people misusing the drug.</p>

                        <p class="paragraphs">A study was carried out from the &lsquo;Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center&rsquo; in Boston who states: &ldquo;In 2015&lsquor; average cost among 162 academic hospitals was <b>$92&lsquor;400 per patient in intensive care</b>.&rdquo; It is clear this is also a problem in how much money it&apos;s costing the US to help overdose patients. According to Beth Israel their study shows in 2015 they spent <b>$8 billion on justice-related costs&lsquor; $20 billion for loss in productivity for businesses</b>. The &lsquo;Nation Safety Council&rsquo; who promotes health and safety in the United States states: &ldquo;some 7 in 10 employers felt some effect of prescription drug use among their employees.&rdquo; When drug use starts to <b>affect people&apos;s jobs and everyday life due to becoming addicted</b> this can become a serious issue for the person&lsquor; as this could lead to job loss&lsquor; not being able to pay for treatments and seeking drugs on the streets.</p>

                        <p class="paragraphs">This brings me back to my point in having <b>opioids doses reduced for prescriptions</b> and having non-medical alternatives for people with chronic and acute pain first&lsquor; before opioids. It is apparent that opioids are highly addictive and people tend to misuse these drugs&lsquor; a <b>non-medical option</b> and reducing the number of opioids can help prevent people from becoming addicted.</p>

                        <p class="paragraphs">The treatment that <b>reverses an opioid overdose is Naloxone</b>&lsquor; this can be very effective for people, according to &lsquo;USA Today&rsquo;&lsquor; who provides the latest world and national news, states&lsquor; &ldquo;the drug naloxone can bring victims of opioid overdoses back from the brink of death&rdquo; and &ldquo;Narcan&lsquor; a naloxone spray can cost $150 per pack.&rdquo; This shows how expensive it is for patients treatment and also <b>doesn&apos;t treat the underlying problem</b>&lsquor; for example&lsquor; an article on CNN Health&lsquor; who provides international news states: &ldquo;a patient had a 1 in 10 chance of not surviving a year after the treatment and 35% of those died a year later from an overdose.&rdquo; This shows that people are <b>struggling to overcome the problem of addiction</b>&lsquor; which suggests to me they are not receiving enough treatment or care in how to recover from this.</p>

                        <p class="paragraphs">But what if <b>people could have something as cheap as $10</b>&lsquor; to keep in their home&lsquor; and use whenever they like to <b>relieve pain or simply as part of a recovery process</b>? This could help people recover and distract them from wanting to take more opioids to relieve their pain. The<b>the answer is Virtual Reality</b>.</p>

People will be immersed in this environment and can perform a series of actions, whether it&apos;s playing a game or watching dolphins underwater. In relation to this, &lsquo;Consultancy Frog&rsquo;, who design digital and physical customer experiences have created a prototype <b>headset as cheap as $10 to help distract patients from pain</b> whilst receiving care for a burn. They carried out research that states: “a custom VR headset needed to be very low cost, as well as durable and water resistant, but still being comfortable to wear.” All of these factors can help create a <b>cheap cost effective headset and suit a wider audience</b>.</p>

        <p class="paragraphs">Following on from discussing low-cost headsets, Brennan Spiegel is carrying out research with Samsung gear headsets. Brennan is a clinical researcher who leads testing in how VR could <b>improve patients outcomes</b> in Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles. Over the years he has carried out trials that prove that 3D goggles can reduce pain, such as in <b>patients with joint injuries and cancer by a quarter.</b></p>

        <p class="paragraphs">Brennan wrote an article on a VR study he carried out in Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, he says: “despite evaluating 510 inpatients for VR, only 30 were both eligible and willing to experience the technology.” The reason people were ineligible to experience VR was due to motion sickness, seizures, stroke, dementia, and nausea. Using the Samsung gear headsets, he found out of 27 people, <b>17 people had positive opinions</b> on the headset while 13 found it uncomfortable. This is why the headset created by Consultancy Frog for as cheap as<b> $10 could help reach a wider audience as their headset is said to be comfortable</b> to wear. I think that more prototyping and studies providing various headsets could help in making people feel more comfortable when wearing the headset.</p>

        <h5 class="vr-subheadings">VR Trials and Research</h5>
        <p class="paragraphs">Brennan has also carried out some interesting research alongside a company called &lsquo;Applied VR&rsquo; who &lsquo;provides a virtual reality platform to offer patients a highly enjoyable <b>escape from scary and painful experiences</b> in healthcare&rsquo;. They are testing content that has longer lasting effects for the patients, content that aids, mindfulness, and cognitive behavioural therapy. They have already proven that a VR game in shooting red teddy bears had a major impact on reducing acute pain, and are now testing how this technology can treat chronic pain.</p>

        <p class="paragraphs">If more trials are carried out to prove that virtual reality works, it could be a <b>non-addictive virtual medicine</b> that could benefit millions of people worldwide and reduce the number of opioids being consumed.</p>

        <p class="paragraphs">The co-founder of &lsquo;Applied VR&rsquo;, Josh Sackman, says: “They can actually control factors inside their body through the practice of breath, intentional focus, and different self-regulation. That we can teach them the power of distraction.” This highlights how powerful VR can be, teaching patients practice of breath and focusing on specific things in order to <b>distract them from painful experiences</b>.</p>

        <p class="paragraphs">A <a class="freethink-link" href="https://www.freethink.com/shows/superhuman/season-3/can-we-treat-pain-with-virtual-reality" title="video of patients experiences using virtual-reality and researchers talking about how effective VR can be">video from &lsquo;Free Think&rsquo;</a>, which is a platform that provides inspiring stories, talks about the studies they have carried out on patients, for example, Harmon Clarke who is a VR trial participant consumes 30 different types of medication. He talks about <b>VR allowing him to go longer without taking pain medication</b>. This shows that patients are able to reduce the amount of opioid consumption by using <b>VR and enable them to experience fewer side effects of the drugs and enjoy using virtual reality as a way to control their pain</b>. Another patient used the VR to watch dolphins underwater, says: “the medicine wears your body out, but using VR she felt much better.” This suggests that <b>VR can provide patients with a non-addictive</b> way of relieving their pain.</p>

        <p class="paragraphs">The overall study found a 50% reduction in pain and <b>reduced the number of opioids prescribed to patients</b>. This highlights that opioids can be reduced for some patients, therefore, <b>lowering the chances that they will become addicted</b> and also providing something that doesn’t wear the patients out. Brennan Spiegel says in the video: “people often ask when they take the headset off do they then need the opioid, the answer is no, it hasn’t cured the underlying disease but for a period of time the brain is in a different place.”</p>

        <p class="paragraphs">This is evident <b>opioids are not needed in some cases</b> when treating patients and really reflects on how powerful virtual reality can be, and how it could help millions of people with pain, both in hospitals and at home. The various studies, trials, and prototypes being carried out on patients will help tailor VR to a wider audience. These studies can also show how effective VR is in reducing the number of opioids, and how it can have an impact in helping the opioid crisis.</p>

        <h5 class="vr-subheadings">A Virtual Snow World</h5>
        <p class="paragraphs">A Virtual reality game called &lsquo;SnowWorld&rsquo; that immerses the patient in a virtual reality snow world and the aim of the game is to shoot penguins with snowballs. This is being tested with burn patients to help <b>distract them from pain when receiving wound care</b>. An article from &lsquo;Slate magazine&rsquo;, which is about Politics, Business, Technology, talks about experiments that have been carried out using ‘SnowWorld’. Slates states: <b>“soldiers reported significant drops in pain while immersed in &lsquo;SnowWorld&rsquo;”</b> and “some of the biggest drops were for the most severe levels of pain.” This shows how effective this game can be in comparison to using drugs, as in this study they used morphine, when they lowered the doses and put them in &lsquo;SnowWorld&rsquo; they reported <b>significant drops in pain</b>.</p>

        <p class="paragraphs">&lsquo;PPS News Hour&rsquo; who provides hour-long evening news broadcasts, interviewed a patient with burn wounds from hot grease in the kitchen, who plays &lsquo;SnowWorld&rsquo; when receiving wound care treatment. In the interview the patient describes the would care treatment as very painful and he takes opioids to help endure the pain, but as well as taking opioids he plays the &lsquo;SnowWorld&rsquo; virtual reality game. He says: “I remember them peeling a bandage thinking this should hurt a lot more, but I was so focused on the game because I was trying to shoot a penguin and not worrying about the nurses taking off the dressings.” This can show how effective this game is in <b>distracting patients from pain</b>.</p>

        <p class="paragraphs">Including people&apos;s views on their experiences can be great in showing how effective VR can be. In the interview, David Tauben who heads the division of pain medicine says: “Virtual reality is a way of moving someone to a different place, a safe place, <b>a place they don't have pain</b>.” Doctors are agreeing that using virtual reality is a great way of reducing pain, this shows that <b>doctors are seeing the benefits and impact it&apos;s having on patients</b>.</p>

        <h4 class="opioids-h4 margin-top">Why Is the Opioid Crisis a Huge Problem?</h4>
        <p class="paragraphs">The opioid crisis is a huge problem for America due to many different factors, the most alarming factor being they are highly addictive and that prescription opioids can account for a large number of overdose deaths. The points below outline <b>why the opioid crisis is a huge problem for America</b>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="opioid-list">One dose of opioids can cause people to become addicted</li>
            <li class="opioid-list">Prescribed opioids account for 25,500 deaths in 2016</li>

        </ul>

        <!------Can Virtual Reality help reduce opioids to prevent addiction?------->
        <h4 class="opioids-h4">What Impact Is It Having in America?</h4>
        <p class="paragraphs">Opioids are having a huge impact on America, one of the main points is, it's killing thousands of people each year and the numbers are only increasing every year. The points below outline the impact it's having on America.</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="opioid-list">72,000 deaths occurred in 2017</li>
            <li class="opioid-list">It's costing the US £500 million nationwide</li>
            <li class="opioid-list">Police force now carry a antidotes</li>
            <li class="opioid-list">91 Amercians die each day to overdoses</li>
            <li class="opioid-list">Can cost a person $3,000 annually for prescription opioids</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="paragraphs">When we look at how many people are dying from prescription opioids, we have to ask ourselves, is the current non opioids methods effective and are they being offered first before opioids? If a patient requires opioids straight after an operation, this is understandable as opioids can control severe pain, but <b>doctors should monitor the number of prescription opioids given to every patient more closely</b>.</p>

        <p class="paragraphs">This also applies to pain such as acute and chronic pain. There is <b>100 million people living in America with chronic pain</b> in 2017 and <b>2 million have misused these prescription opioids</b> for the first time in 2016 and 2017. I believe this evidence is clear in that <b>opioids can and should be reduced</b>, therefore people will less likely become addicted to opioids as they are consuming lower doses.</p>

        <!------Can Virtual Reality help reduce opioids to prevent addiction?------->
        <h4 class="vr-h4 margin-top-6">Can Virtual Reality Help Reduce Opioids to Prevent Addiction?</h4>
        <p class="paragraphs">Yes, Virtual Reality can help control pain with lower doses of opioids and in some cases no opioids. Analysing the studies I found shows that VR could be a non addictive medicine, and it can help reduce opioid consumption to prevent addiction. The points below outline how vr can help this crisis.</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="vr-list">VR is <b>non addictive</b></li>
            <li class="vr-list">Significant drops in pain using VR compared to using opioids</li>

            <li class="vr-list">It can be a <b>fun experience</b> for the user</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="conclusion"></div>
        <h5 class="introduction">Conclusion</h5>
        <p class="paragraphs">In conclusion, VR creates a <b>better experiences for patients</b>, they can be taken out of reality and <b>immersed in a completely different setting, in a more relaxed atmosphere</b>, such as being underwater with dolphins or sitting with Dr.Phil. The opioid crisis is becoming a huge problem in how much it can cost patients, it can cost someone annually around $3,500 for prescription opioids. VR can be a great <b>non addictive cheap alternative</b>. A <b>VR app can cost as cheap as $20</b>, a headset that Consultancy Frog developed can cost as little as $10 and a smartphone on average can cost $500. This could save people up to $3000 on prescription opioids.</p>

        <p class="paragraphs">People can use this anywhere, in the comfort of their own home and also in hospitals, where people can have their own headsets, which can prevent infection from spreading. This could <b>help the 2 million people that have a disorder to prescription opioids</b>. VR could be their <b>coping mechanism when they experience triggers</b> for opioids and enable them to manage their addiction. Virtual reality is a non-opioid approach that can help reduce the number of prescribed opioids, which can then help lower the number of people becoming addicted. <b>VR has the power to positively contribute to resolving the opioid crisis</b> in helping the millions of people becoming addicted. It has the <b>potential to be the new medicine that everyone can experience</b>, and immerse them in a virtual reality world.</p>
