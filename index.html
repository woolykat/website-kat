          <h3>Why is the opioid crisis a huge problem in America, is there a way to reduce opioid consumption to prevent addiction? And how is Virtual Reality games and apps helping people with pain?</p>
          <p>Will virtual reality become a new non-addictive medicine in hospitals?</p></h3>
          <h5 class="introduction">Introduction</h5>
          <p class="paragraphs">I will explore the opioid crisis in America and discuss how dangerous opioids can be. I will do this through discussing various side effects they have on people and using statistics to show how huge the problem is becoming, for example how the death toll is rising each year due to overdoses on opioids. I will talk about how prescription opioids play a huge part in people becoming addicted to these drugs and resulting in death, and are they receiving too much medication from doctors when it could be reduced. As well as discussing how dangerous and addictive these opioids are, I will analyse how much it’s costing the United States each year and the cost of treatments in overdoses. In addition to this I will deliberate how doctors are agreeing that VR is effective in reducing pain. I will also talk about Brennan Spiegel, a researcher at Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, who has carried out various trials with patients and give quotes from people who have experienced VR to reduce their pain. These studies also show that in some cases opioids are not needed.
          I will discuss the studies and prototypes of virtual reality and how it could decrease the number of prescribed opioids given to patients, how it can help assist in their recovery process and how cost effective having your own headset could be.</p>

      <h2>The Opioid Crisis</h2>
     
  </header>
        <div class="width">
          <h5 class="opioid-subheadings">What are opioids and how dangerous are they?</h5>
          <p class="paragraphs">Opioids block pain signals sent from the brain to the body, most people use prescription opioids for chronic pain as well as acute pain. There are various forms of opioids, for example, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, morphine, codeine, and fentanyl, which are common prescription opioids. Opioids such as morphine and fentanyl are used in treating moderate to severe pain, for example after surgery, chronic pain, patients with poor heart function and many more. They can be taken in many different forms, for example, injections, tablets, liquids, and patches. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, who is making advances on addiction science states: “opioids release large amounts of dopamine. This release can strongly reinforce the act of taking the drug, making the user want to repeat the experience”. This suggests how addictive opioids can be and is the cause of many deaths due to overdoses, especially in the United States. A statement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who are a leading national public health institute of the United States says; “Every day, 91 Americans die from an opioid-related overdose”. This shows how dangerous opioids can be, with a large number of people dying every day.  According to ‘Pain Doctor’, a website that helps people learn more about their conditions, states: “25 million Americans suffer daily pain” and American Psychiatric Association says that “an estimated 2 million people have a substance disorder”. Not only are thousands of people dying, but millions of people are addicted and misusing opioids, which will only lead to more and more deaths occurring each year.</p>

          <p class="paragraphs">In some cases patients can become reliant on drugs after surgery, because of how opioid molecules act on the brain, this may make them misuse it and become addicted.  In 2017 the University of Michigan researched opioid addiction across various schools to find out how prescribing can be improved, they state that “1 in 20 young adults uses opioids for too long after common surgeries” and “teens were getting refills three to six months after a surgery”. Patients continue to get refills long after surgery, why is this? Is there not a restricted number of opioids you receive? Jay Lee, a researcher from the University of Michigan says: “it’s embarrassing to admit this, but we’ve never had any evidence to inform how much opioids we prescribe to surgical patients”. I find this very alarming as some patients could become addicted to a drug that they could have stopped
          taking months ago. The longer someone is taking an opioid they are at at higher risk of becoming addicted, as a video from ‘Free Think’, a publication that profiles “people thinking differently and making a difference”, says: “if you take one dose of opioids, there is a 6% chance that 12 months later you will be dependent on it.” This suggests how highly addictive this drug can be, and when people are receiving prescriptions long after surgeries they are more at risk at becoming addicted and could lead to death if an overdose occurs. Providing more non addictive options are needed for patients and doctors need to offer this first and be more strict on prescribing opioids As Dr. Jennifer Waljee, who is a co-director of the Michigan opioids prescribing engagement network says: “I think to take very simple measures — such as asking patients about their preferences for pain control after surgery and their prior experiences with surgery — can reduce the prescribing of opioids and on top of this, surgeons may offer patients non-opioid approaches to pain.” Although I don’t believe that every doctor and surgeon will provide non-opioid options, as you can see people are receiving opioids 3 to 6 months after surgery when it isn’t required, and many deaths occur to prescription opioids, doctors should be monitoring this more closely in order to stop the number of opioids being prescribed. A lot of people use opioids for chronic pain, which is pain that lasts more than 12 weeks, months or longer. According to the VR Fitness Insider, who focuses on how VR and AR can improve health and fitness, says: “more than 100 million people in America are living with chronic pain, with the United States accounting for 80% of painkiller use worldwide in 2017” This suggests a lot of people could be taking opioids as a treatment for their chronic pain, as the US accounts for 80% of painkiller use worldwide. As chronic pain can last months or years, patients are more likely to become addicted when taking opioids to control their pain.</p>


         <h5 class="opioid-subheadings">Side Effects of Opioids</h5>
          <p class="paragraphs">Opioids can have various side effects, these can vary depending on the person and how long people are taking the drug for. Some side effects are drowsiness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and slowed breathing. Many people can experience side effects of these drugs, the Faculty Of Pain Medicine who is responsible for training and development of specialist medical practitioners says: “50 - 80% of patients experience at least one side effect.” So how serious are the side effects if someone is misusing the drug? Misuse of this drug can cause hypoxia, a condition when too little oxygen reaches the brain. When this happens it can have long-term effects, such as a coma, permanent brain damage, and death. People can also experience respiratory depression, which is a breathing disorder, with slow ineffective breathing. This can be more severe the higher the dose of opioids and sometimes can lead to respiratory failure, which is the most common cause for death in someone that has an overdose.</p>

          <blockquote>"72,000 overdose deaths in 2017 related to opioids"</blockquote>

         <h5 class="opioid-subheadings">Shocking Statistics</h5>
          <p class="paragraphs">When you look at statistics showing how big this crisis has become, it’s alarming to read how many people are dying due to overdoses in America. A statistic from the Centers for Disease Control says: “72,000 overdose deaths in 2017 were attributed to opioids”. That’s around 6,000 people dying each month and it’s a 13% increase from 2016, with 63,632 deaths. The problem has only gotten worse, with the increase in deaths rising much higher from 2015 with 52,404 deaths. An article from Ashwood Recovery, who is a private highly specialized, substance abuse treatment center says, “every new year sets a new record – for 19 consecutive years, overdose deaths increased by 421%.” This highlights that over the last 19 years from 1999 to 2017, the number of deaths have only gotten higher and will continue to grow as people are becoming reliant on these drugs. The United States Department of Health and Human Services says: “2 million people misused the prescription opioids for the first time in 2016 and 2017”. Not only are thousands of people dying but millions of people are misusing opioids, resulting in overdose deaths. This highlights how addictive opioids are, even when people are taking prescription opioids. If the number of opioids could be reduced, people will become less dependent on these drugs. If we take for example someone with chronic pain who normally can have this pain for months or longer and they consume opioids, they are likely to continue to use this drug and are at a higher risk of becoming addicted due to the length of time they consume opioids. Researchers at Mayo Clinic, who specializes in treating patients say: “the odds you’ll still be on opioids a year after starting a short course, increase, after only five days on opioids.” So even after taking the opioid for a few days they are at risk of becoming addicted. Are opioids really necessary for people with chronic pain? In my opinion no, as patients will eventually become addicted as chronic pain can last months and even years in some cases. As Mayo Clinic also says: “opioids are a last resort for chronic pain management, they may be the right choice for long-term pain related cancer and it’s treatments”. I understand people can react differently to medications, what works for one person may not for the next person. Although I strongly feel that the focus on reducing the opioids given to patients and making it the last resort should be the case in all patients, and especially ensuring patients are not receiving prescription opioids for longer than needed. A statement from Inspiring Wellness, who help people that suffers from addiction and their recovery says: “40% percent of these opioid-related deaths involved prescription opioids in 2016”. Thats around 25,500 people that died due to prescribed opioids, which highlights that a growing number of patients are becoming dependent on prescription opioids.</p>  

          <h5 class="opioid-subheadings">Cost</h5>
          <p class="paragraphs">As the opioid crisis is growing, so is the cost for medical care, according to ‘Market
            Watch’, who provides the latest stock market, financial and business news, says: “the crisis is costing the U.S more than $500 billion per year nationwide”,“28 million on medical care alone” and “the annual cost of addiction to prescription opioids is $3,500 to $70,000”. These are worrying figures as this shows how much it’s costing for people misusing the drug, and according to CNBC who provides the ‘latest business news on stock markets, financial and earnings’ says: “The economic cost of the growing opioid epidemic topped an estimated $1 trillion from 2001 through 2017”. This crisis is only growing each year both in the number of deaths occurring each year and the costs. A study was carried out from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who found that “In 2015, average cost among 162 academic hospitals was $92,400 per patient in intensive care”. It is clear this is also a problem in how much money it’s costing the US to help overdose patients. According to Beth Israel their study shows in 2015 they spent $8 billion on justice-related costs, $20 billion for loss in productivity for businesses. The Nation Safety Council who promotes health and safety in the United States says “some 7 in 10 employers felt some effect of prescription drug use among their employees, including absenteeism or decreased job performance”. When drug use starts to affect people’s jobs and everyday life due to becoming addicted this can become a serious issue for the person, as this could lead to job loss, not being able to pay for treatments and seeking drugs on the streets. This brings me back to my point in having opioids doses reduced for prescriptions and having non-medical alternatives for people with chronic and acute pain first, before opioids. It is apparent that opioids are highly addictive and people tend to misuse these drugs, a non-medical option and reducing the number of opioids can help prevent people from becoming addicted.

            A documentary on the deadliest drug crisis in America interviews a police officer, Andy Teague from Ohio who talks about how the police force need to carry a heroin antidote around as they treat people with this up to 4 or 5 times a day. In this documentary it shows a girl who is deeply stressed about her brother overdosing, as her dad recently died from an overdose. It is highly impacting her life and she's very upset about her brothers addiction, she says: ”I have tried to keep my family sober, every day it is hell, hell, every day it is hell going through this.” This shows how it’s having a huge impact on families and how serious drug addiction is having on people. The treatment that reverses an opioid overdose is Naloxone, this can be very
            effective for people as it states from USA Today, who provides the latest world and national news, says: “the drug naloxone can bring victims of opioid overdoses back from the brink of death” and “Narcan, a naloxone spray can cost $150 per pack”. This shows how expensive it is for patients' treatment and also doesn't treat the underlying problem, for example, an article on CNN Health, who provides international news states: “a patient had a 1 in 10 chance of not surviving a year after the treatment. About 35% of those died a year
            later from an overdose.” This shows that people are struggling to overcome the problem of addiction, which suggests to me they are not receiving enough treatment or care in how to recover from this.
             
            But what if people could have something as cheap as $10, to keep in their home, and use Whenever they like to relieve pain or simply as part of a recovery process? This could help people recover and distract them from wanting to take more opioids to relieve their pain.</p>

                    <h2>A new virtual reality medicine</h2>

                <div class="width">
                <h5 class="vr-subheadings">Cost effective headsets</h5>
                  <p class="paragraphs">
                    Virtual reality is a three dimensional image or environment that can be explored by a person. People will be immersed in this environment and can perform a series of actions, whether it’s playing a game or watching dolphins underwater. In relation to this; ‘Consultancy Frog’, who design digital and physical customer experiences have created a prototype headset as cheap as $10 to help distract patients from pain when receiving wound care. The headset will show a VR game which is used for a pain distraction method. They carried out research that states: “research showed that the custom VR headset needed to be very low cost, as well as durable and water resistant, but still being comfortable to wear.” All of these factors can help create a cheap cost effective headset and suit a wider audience.  Following on from discussing low cost headsets, Brennan Spiegel is carrying out research with Samsung gear headsets. Brennan is a clinical researcher who leads testing in how VR could improve patients outcomes in Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles. Over the years he has carried out trials that prove that 3D goggles can reduce pain, such as in patients with joint injuries and cancer by a quarter. He has carried out some interesting research alongside a company called Applied VR who ‘provides a virtual reality platform to offer patients a highly enjoyable escape from scary and painful experiences in healthcare’ They are testing content that has longer lasting effects for the patients, content that aids, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. They have already proven that a VR game in shooting red teddy bears had a major impact on reducing acute pain, and are now testing how this technology can treat chronic pain. If more trials are carried out to prove that virtual reality works, it could be the new non-addictive virtual medicine that could benefit millions of people worldwide. The co founder of Applied VR, Josh Sackman, says: “They can actually control factors inside their body through practice of breath, intentional focus, and different self-regulation. That we can teach them the power of distraction”. This highlights how powerful VR can be teaching patients practice of breath and focusing on specific things in order to distract them from painful experiences. Brennan also wrote an article on a VR study he carried out in Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, he says “we found that despite evaluating 510 inpatients for VR, only 30 (6%) were both eligible and willing to experience the technology”. The reason people were ineligible to experience VR was due to motion sickness, seizures, stroke, dementia, and nausea. They used Samsung Gear headsets in another study and out of 27 people, 17 people had positive opinions on the headset while 13 found it uncomfortable. This is why the headset created by Consultancy Frog for as cheap as $10 could help reach a wider audience as their headset is said to be comfortable to wear. I think that more prototyping and studies providing various headsets could help in making people feel more comfortable when wearing the headset.</p>

                    <h5 class="vr-subheadings">Freethink video</h5>
                    <p class="paragraphs">A video from Free Think, which is a platform that provides inspiring stories, talks about the studies they have carried out on patients, for example, Harmon Clarke who is a VR trial participant consumes 30 different types of medication. He talks about VR allowing him to go longer without taking pain medication. This shows that patients are able to reduce the amount of opioid consumption by using VR and enable them to experience fewer side effects of the drugs and enjoy using virtual reality as a way to control their pain. Another patient used the VR to watch dolphins underwater, says, “the medicine wears your body out, but using VR she felt much better.” This suggests that VR can provide patients with a non-medical way of relieving their pain. The overall study found a 50% reduction in pain and reduced the number of opioids prescribed to patients. This highlights that opioids can be reduced for some patients, therefore, lowering the chances that they will become addicted and also providing something that doesn’t wear the patients out. I say some patients as some will require opioids in more severe situations, such as after surgery and treating cancer. Brennan Spiegel says in the video: “people often ask when they take the headset off do they then need they opioid, the answer is no, it hasn’t cured the underlying disease but for a period of time the brain is in a different place”. This is evident opioids are not needed in some cases when treating patients and really reflects on how powerful virtual reality can be, and how it could help millions of people with pain, both in hospitals and at home. As with many different studies, experiments and prototypes being carried out on patients and a range of different headsets, it can help tailor to a wider audience.</p>

                    <h5 class="vr-subheadings">Virtual Reality Treatment</h5>
                    <p class="paragraphs">Many different studies have been carried out to test virtual reality games in hospitals, one in particular that has been very effective is a game called ‘Snow World’. ‘Snow World’ is a game where you are immersed in a virtual reality snow world and the aim of the game is to shoot penguins with snowballs. This is being tested with burn patients to help distract them from pain when receiving wound care. An article from Slate, which is a magazine about Politics, Business, Technology, and the Arts, talks about experiments that have been carried out using ‘Snow World’. Slates says: “soldiers reported significant drops in pain while immersed in SnowWorld” and “some of the biggest drops were for the most severe levels of pain”. This shows how effective this game can be in comparison to using drugs, as in this study they used morphine, but when they lowered the doses and put them in ‘Snow World’ they reported significant drops in pain. PPS News Hour who provides an hour-long evening news broadcast, interviewed a patient with burn wounds from hot grease in the kitchen, who plays snow world when receiving wound care treatment. In the interview the patient describes the would care treatment as very painful and he takes opioids to help endure the pain, but as well as taking opioids he plays the ‘Snow World’ virtual reality game. He says “I remember them peeling a bandage thinking this should hurt a lot more, but I was so focused on the game because I was trying to shoot a penguin and not worrying about the nurses taking off the dressings.” This can show how effective this game is in distracting users from pain. Including people’s views on their experiences can be great in showing how effective VR can be. In the interview David Tauben who heads the division of pain medicine says: “Virtual reality is a way of moving someone to a different place, a safe place, a place they don't have pain.” Doctors are agreeing that using virtual reality is a great way of reducing pain, this shows how effective VR can be and that many doctors are seeing the benefits and impact it’s having on patients.</p>

                    <h5 class="vr-subheadings">Virtual World Therapy</h5>
                    <p class="paragraphs">In relation to reducing pain with virtual reality, it can also help for therapy in assisting people recovering from an overdose or people seeking help for the
                    addiction problem. VR can take people with an addiction problem And immerse them in a different setting. Dr.Phil McGraw, one of the most well-known mental health professionals in the world developed a ‘Path to Recovery VR program’ that launched in 2017. It is a therapy method in helping reduce relapse and improve overall outcomes for in-patient and drug and alcohol rehabilitation. The program addresses a range of topics including coping skills, rewarding, managing recovery, relaxation, thought processes, and emotions. An article from ‘Recovery Boot Camp’, which is an addiction treatment center for men talks about a patient that had experience using Dr.Phil’s program. In it he stated: “Do I think Dr. Phil's Path to Recovery will "cure" me of my addiction? Of course not. But it will most certainly aid those who are battling addiction.” This suggests that VR therapy could help in fighting against addiction and aid in the recovery process. Dr.Phil also talks about program there are methods for coping, which creates a unique experience for the patient and immerses them in a safe setting that triggers their addiction. If someone was struggling with drug addiction, they would be immersed at a bar or at home, depending on what triggers certain people have. It also allows you to see Dr.Phil and hear him speak to you as if you were in the same room together.
                    </p>


                    <h5 class="introduction">Overall</h5>
                    <p class="paragraphs">Overall the opioid crisis is a huge problem for Americans through many different factors, the most important being how addictive these drugs are and the fact that even prescription opioids can account for a large number of overdose deaths. You can see from research from 1999 to 2017, the number of deaths have only risen, with an overall 421% increase over 19 years, and in recent years, in 2016 opioids deaths were around 63,000 and in 2017, 72,000 deaths, that’s a 14% increase in just 1 year. Opioids are highly addictive as Brennan Spiegel an experienced clinical researcher, says: “if you take one dose of opioids, there is a 6% chance that 12 months later you will be dependent on it”. Patients are also receiving opioids 3 to 6 months after surgery, which is exposing them to being at higher risk to being addicted. Dr. Jennifer Waljee the co-director in opioid prescribing says: “surgeons may offer patients non-opioid approaches to pain”. When we look at how many people are dying from prescription opioids, for example in 2016, 25,500 deaths occurred. Is the current non opioids methods effective and are they being offered first before opioids. If a patient requires opioids straight after an operation, this is understandable as they can control severe pain, but doctors need to reduce the amount given to a patient when they overcome their surgery. This also applies to pain such as acute and chronic pain. There is 100 million people living in America with chronic pain in 2017 and 2 million have misused this prescription opioids for the first time in 2017 and 2017. The opioid crisis is costing can cost someone around $3,500 to $70,000 annually.

                    Brennan Spiegel proves in his studies that opioids can be reduced, he has proven this through various trials and research. In one of the studies he found a 50% reduction in pain and reduced the number of opioids prescribed to patients. This evidence is clear that opioids can be reduced, therefore people will less likely become addicted to opioids as they are consuming lower doses. Even in some case Brennan talks about how people don’t need the opioid after using VR, and results in no opioid use. In this study a patient called Harmon Clarke who consumed around 30 different types of medication a day is now able to go longer without medication when using VR. The VR trials carried out with burn patients using the ‘Snow World’ proved that they could lower the doses of morphine given to patients. Doctors are now really seeing the impact VR has on patients. VR can also help assist people in their recovery instead of medication, for example the program Dr.Phil has developed can be a great way in immersing people in a virtual world where they can feel safe.</p>

                    <h5 class="introduction">Conclusion</h5>
                    <p class="paragraphs">In conclusion VR creates better experiences for patients, they can be taken out of reality and immersed in a completely different setting into a more relaxed atmosphere, such as being underwater with dolphins, or sitting with Dr.Phil. As the opioid crisis is becoming a huge problem in how much it can cost patients, for example it can cost someone annually around $3,500 for prescription opioids. VR can be a great non addictive alternative. A virtual reality app can cost as cheap as $20, a headset that Consultancy Frog developed can cost as cheap as $10 and a smartphone on average can cost $500. This could save people up to $3000 on prescription opioids. People can use this anywhere, in the comfort of their own home and also use in hospitals, where people can have their own headsets, which can prevent infection spreading. This could help the 2 million people that have a disorder to prescription opioids. VR could be their coping mechanism when they experience triggers for opioids and enable them to manage their addiction. Virtual reality is a non opioid approach that can help reduce the number of prescribed opioids, which can then help lowering the number of people becoming addicted. VR has the power to contribute to this crises in helping the millions of people becoming addicted, it could be the new medicine that everyone can experience, and immerse them in a virtual reality world.</p>
